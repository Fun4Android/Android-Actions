I don't own all these scripts,the devs of these scripts discontinued it so i took them all & modified them. & now they are working fine;)

What's github action?
- GitHub Actions makes it easy to automate all your software workflows, now with world-class CI/CD. Build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub. Make code reviews, branch management, and issue triaging work the way you want.
In brief you can use it for building stuffs without any cost. You can use it like a virtual machine too(technically,search for SSH github action) you can make everything automated by writing githuh action scripts. For example: Android tinkering needs linux distros. So we can use almost every distros like Ubuntu, alphine,arch etc.Github actions make building softwares & stuffs super easy.
